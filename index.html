          <p> im a second-year phd student in the <a href="http://med.stanford.edu/genetics.html">genetics department</a> at stanford. previously, i was a research assistant in the <a href="https://www.mskcc.org/research/ski/labs/dana-pe-er">dana pe'er lab</a> at sloan kettering. i received my b.s. degree in computer science with a minor in statistics from columbia.

          <p> imagine a hematopoietic stem cell chilling in the bone marrow. at some point it replicates itself many times. with each cell divison, the daughter cells look less like the stem cell and more like something else. eventually, the stem cell's descendants become immune cells with very different personalities and preferences. these immune cells then enter the blood and travel the whole body. some of them end up in a growing tumor, and the story gets a lot more complicated from there.

          <p> im curious about the behaviors of different circulating immune cells as they enter and maybe settle down in the tumor ecosystem (tumor consists of not only cancer cells, but also non-cancer stromal cells and resident immune cells). what in the tumor attracts or repels different immune cells? how does the tumor reshape each of their identities? what is the rate of each immune cell's entry into the tumor? which immune cells replicate themselves in the tumor, and to what extent? and finally a really wild thing i recently learned, how could the tumor remotely influence immune cells in the blood or even in the bone marrow?! and could that alter immune cells' behaviors when they engage with the tumor???

          <p> im currently trynna figure out the answers to some of these questions using single-cell multiomic technologies and clinical patient samples. to get the answers i want, i sometimes engineer computational tools when nothing exisiting does what i need. im also interested in all things biotech and entrepreneurship. let's chat!
